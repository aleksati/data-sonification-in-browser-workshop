We will explore the use of visuals and sound in a creative way while still preserving coherence with the data bring rendered. Sonification refers to the use of non-speech audio to convey information or perceptualize data. Using the browser as a display tool drastically simplifies dissemination with peers and communication with the general public. As a bonus, we will show you how to embed this in your UiO personal page.

### Learning outcomes

- Learn easy-to-use Javascript libraries for dynamic visualization and sonification.
- Learn to creatively map pre-recorded or real-time data and to sound and visuals.
- Learn to integrate data visualization and sonification in a web page.

### Prerequisites

Familiarity with any text-based programming language (e.g., if/else statements, loops, arrays, functions, etc.). In the workshop, we will write some simple Javascript code.

### Target audience

PhDs, Postdocs, Technical personnel, and Students.

### Required Materials

- Laptop with a [Chromium browser](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)>) and a text editor installed (e.g., [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)).

* An account on [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/).

### Local setup

If you prefer to work with coding locally, e.g with files on your machine instead of in the browser, you can follow these steps to setup a local environment with visual studio code.

1. Download a template sketch from the p5 web editor.
