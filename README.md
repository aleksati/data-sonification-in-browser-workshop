## Intro

Learn how to display multidimensional data using dynamic images and sound in the browser. In collaboration with the Digital Scholarship Days at the University of Oslo.

We will explore the use of visuals and sound in a creative way while still preserving coherence with the data bring rendered. Sonification refers to the use of non-speech audio to convey information or perceptualize data. Using the browser as a display tool drastically simplifies dissemination with peers and communication with the general public. As a bonus, we will show you how to embed this in your UiO personal page.

For location and additional information, visit the [official event page](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/courses-events/events/all-libraries/2023/digital-scholarship-days/data-visualization.html).

## Learning outcomes

- Learn easy-to-use Javascript libraries for dynamic visualization and sonification.
- Learn to creatively map pre-recorded or real-time data and to sound and visuals.
- Learn to integrate data visualization and sonification in a web page.

## Requirements

- Familiarity with any text-based programming language (e.g., if/else statements, loops, arrays, functions, etc.). In the workshop, we will write Javascript code. The workshop is for people interested in data sonification and/or creating computing, wheter it be PhDs, postdocs, other technical personnel and/or students.

- Laptop with a [chromium browser](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)>)

## Setup

You can either work directly from the browser, via p5's own web editor, or from your local machine. Here is how you do it:

### Browser (recommended)

1. Download this repository.

2. Create an account on the [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/).

3. Go to "My Sketches" and create a new sketch.

4. In the web editor of your new sketch, open the sidebar to access your files.

5. Via the small dropdown menu, choose to "upload file" and drag and drop the "src -> browser" folder into the square.

6. To make our enviornment a little cleaner, create a folder for the "examples" and "data" files.

### Local

1. Download this repository.

2. Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

3. Import the "src -> local" folder into Visual Studio Code. **Change picture**
