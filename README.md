## Intro

Learn how to display multidimensional data using dynamic images and sound in the browser. In collaboration with the Digital Scholarship Days at the University of Oslo.

We will explore the use of visuals and sound in a creative way while still preserving coherence with the data bring rendered. Sonification refers to the use of non-speech audio to convey information or perceptualize data. Using the browser as a display tool drastically simplifies dissemination with peers and communication with the general public. As a bonus, we will show you how to embed this in your UiO personal page.

## Learning outcomes

- Learn easy-to-use Javascript libraries for dynamic visualization and sonification.
- Learn to creatively map pre-recorded or real-time data and to sound and visuals.
- Learn to integrate data visualization and sonification in a web page.

## Requirements

- Familiarity with any text-based programming language (e.g., if/else statements, loops, arrays, functions, etc.). In the workshop, we will write Javascript code. The workshop is for people interested in data sonification and/or creating computing, wheter it be PhDs, postdocs, other technical personnel and/or students.

- Laptop with a [Chromium browser](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)>)

## Setup

You can follow the entire workshop via the p5's web editor, just create an account on [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/). No additional setup is required.

### Local setup

If you prefer to work with coding locally, e.g with files on your machine instead of in the browser, you can follow these steps to setup a local environment with the Visual Studio Code text editor.

1. Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

2. Download a template sketch from the p5 web editor.
