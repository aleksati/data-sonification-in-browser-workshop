We will explore the use of visuals and sound in a creative way while still preserving coherence with the data bring rendered. Sonification refers to the use of non-speech audio to convey information or perceptualize data. Using the browser as a display tool drastically simplifies dissemination with peers and communication with the general public. As a bonus, we will show you how to embed this in your UiO personal page.

## Learning outcomes

- Learn easy-to-use Javascript libraries for dynamic visualization and sonification.
- Learn to creatively map pre-recorded or real-time data and to sound and visuals.
- Learn to integrate data visualization and sonification in a web page.

## Requirements

- Familiarity with any text-based programming language (e.g., if/else statements, loops, arrays, functions, etc.). In the workshop, we will write Javascript code. The workshop is for people interested in data sonification and/or creating computing, wheter it be PhDs, postdocs, other technical personnel and/or students.

- Laptop with a [chromium browser](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)>) (e.g Chrome, Firefox, Brave etc.).

## Setup

You can either work directly from the browser, via p5's own web editor, or from your local machine. Here is how you do it:

5. Via the small dropdown menu "Sketch Files" in the left column of the web editor, choose to "upload file" and drag and drop the "browser" folder into the popup square.

6. In the "Sketch Files" menu, select the dropdown menu for the files "index.html", "sketch.js", and "style.css" and choose "Delete" to clear all default sketch files.

### Local (advanced)

1. Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

2. Download this repository.

3. Import the "local" folder into Visual Studio Code.

4. Install the "Live Server" extenstion in Visual Studio Code.

5. Right-click on the "index.html" file in the root directory and select "open with Live Server".
